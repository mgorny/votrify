Hi.  I am going to interactively guide you through verifying your vote
in ${ELECTION} election and uploading a signed confirmation of this.\
${RESET}

${YELLOW}\
Privacy note:  I will ask you a few questions.  Your answers will not
be included in the confirmation, nor sent anywhere.  The confirmation
will be signed using your OpenPGP key.  Therefore, it will not be
anonymous.  However, it will expose anything about your participation
(or lack of) in the election; only the fact that you've chosen to help
with the verification.  I will print the whole confirmation to you
and request final confirmation before uploading it.\
${RESET}

${GREEN}\
You will need working GnuPG with your signing key (in order to sign
the confirmation), and SSH client with access to dev.gentoo.org
(in order to fetch your vote and upload the confirmation).  You will
also need your confirmation ID, if you have voted in the election.

Should at any point you choose not to proceed, or start over, you can
safely abort the script with ${WHITE}^c${GREEN}.\

First, I will verify that your vote has been correctly recorded
in the master ballot.  Then, we're going to count the votes.  If your
vote is still present on dev.gentoo.org, I can fetch it for you.\

In that case, we're going to only count the votes.  Nevertheless, your
confirmation will help verify that no extraneous votes were added
to the master ballot.\

Now we're ready to create the confirmation.  If you'd like to use
another OpenPGP key than the default to sign it, please type its
identifier below (in any form acceptable to GnuPG, e.g. fingerprint,
e-mail, name).  If you'd like to use the default key, just push enter.
If you'd like to abort, ${WHITE}^c${GREEN}.

Now I would like to upload it to dev.gentoo.org.  If you agree, please
either type your nickname (preferably the dev name, to avoid collisions)
or press enter to use the name of the current user.  If you do not wish
to upload the confirmation, please abort via ${WHITE}^c${GREEN}.\

It seems that all went well.  Thanks a lot for helping out!  If you'd
